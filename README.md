#vim-python-quickstart

The idea behind this repo is to provide a basic skeleton or reference of how a vim plugin powered by Python should be structured. 
It has the right structure for [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), so it should be as easy as cloning
in the ´.vim/bundle/vim-python-quickstart´ folder.

Happy Hacking!
